I have a problem using `build.rs` and `OUT_DIR` and I would love some help figuring it out. My issue is that `OUT_DIR` is not defined when I 'cargo build', even though it is defined when my `build.rs` runs. This line in `build.rs` succeeds: `let out_dir = env::var_os("OUT_DIR").unwrap();` but this line in my `src/` dir fails: `const OUT_DIR: &str = env!("OUT_DIR");` with the error: "environment variable OUT_DIR not defined."
I'd really appreciate any ideas anyone might have. I've dug through all the docs, examples, read the cargo source code, read a bunch of issues against cargo on github, it seems as though the behavior should be that if I have a `build.rs` file in my project root (which I do, and it is being run on build), then `OUT_DIR` should be available to be read as an environment variable within my code at compile time, like it is in this example here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-script-examples.html#code-generation
This is an attempt at making a minimum reproducible example (my problem is occuring in a kind of medium sized project) but I can't reproduce it. The issue affects my larger project, but when I try it here, it works perfectly. I would love to hear any ideas of additional places I could look to figure out why Cargo is not setting this value for me.
